# Procedural Dungeon Plugin

Author : Beno√Æt PELLETIER

## Overview
This is an Unreal Engine 4 plugin to create procedural dungeons by arranging a set of room like "The Binding of Isaac" or "Rogue Legacy" but in 3D.

This procedural dungeon uses hand-created rooms that are Unreal levels.

You define your own rules to generate the dungeon.

If you want more details about how it works and how to use it, please read the [wiki](https://github.com/BenPyton/ProceduralDungeon/wiki).

If you have any suggestion/bug or you want to contribute, don't hesitate to add an issue or do a pull request.

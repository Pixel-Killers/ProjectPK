# ProjectPK
RPG rogue-like 2D sidescroller made in UE4.

Sprint 1:
Known bugs:
* Jump from ladder is tricky as the character "bumps" into collision. Jumping straight causes a "sudden fly" effect. Potential fix: integration with the X axis input (from A and D buttons);
* Start level does not set correctly through the project settings;
